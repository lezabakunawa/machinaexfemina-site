            <h1>Our Philosophy</h1><br>
            <h2>We believe in equity and giving equal opportunity to those who are capable</h2>
            <br>
            <b>Women are a vital part of tech and broader science; however, they are not often encouraged to pursue these endeavors</b>
            <br><br>
            Women are underrepresented in the field of tech. This is due to outdated gender ideas, such as the idea women are less capable of performing the skills required of tech such as logic, science, and math.
            <br>
            There is a lot of historical evidence that suggests otherwise, as well as many modern women who have proven themselves time and time again in the field of tech and broader STEM environment.
            <br>
            <br>Women should be encouraged to pursue whatever they prefer, and be where ever they want to be!

            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; background-color: transparent;">Helping people who are skilled but lack resources and support is important</p>
            <br>
            To improve our society, individuals who are from less than favorable circumstances should be given a chance to make better lives for themselves. This is done by giving them a fair opportunity to foster their skills, learn new skills, and thrive in a safe, consistent, and supportive environment. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, we know that helping those of less than favorable circumstances requires educators and mentors with not just the skills, but also empathetic insight into their lives. Furthermore, they should be surrounded by peers who are like-minded.

            We are physically located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is ranked in the bottom 99% quartile of the United States education system. Additionally, Las Vegas has one of the highest uemployment rates in the United States.
            <br><br>
            Our long term goal is to help alleviate these numbers, not just by mentoring our patrons, but also promoting an overall culture of education, personal growth and responsibility, and responsibility to one's community.
