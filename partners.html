            <h1>Our Partners</h1>
            <h2>We greatly appreciate support from all of our partners</h2>
            <br>
            Live now; make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records. I object to intellect without discipline; I object to power without constructive purpose. Now, I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love, when every day is a struggle to survive. But I do insist that you do survive, because the days and the years ahead are worth living for!  Live Long and Prosper.

            What makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. Insufficient facts always invite danger. I speak of rights! A machine has none; a man must. If you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine; indeed, you have elevated that machine above us!  A lie is a very poor way to say hello. I've done far worse than kill you. …I've hurt you; and I intend to go on… hurting you. I will leave you as you left me; as you left her. Marooned for all eternity at the center of a dead planet. …Buried alive; buried alive….
